  <h2 class="highlight">Lady Penh?</h2>    
  <div>
    <p>The original <em>Lady Penh</em> is the mythical founder of Phnom
      Penh. See <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh_Legend">here</a>
      for more information.</p>       
    <p>Lady Penh - this website - is all about <em>events in Phnom
        Penh</em>. We are a bunch of fellow PhnomPenhers with the feeling
      that our city is somewhat at crossroads: it's getting kind of
      tough to keep track of what's going on here - which had not been
      <em>too hard</em> until now (to say the least). Phnom Penh is
      awakening... And this website is our participation to this
      process. <strong>What to do in Phnom Penh:</strong> you can now ask Lady
      Penh, spread the word!!! If you have any question, suggestion, 
      or just want to shout your love, be our guest:</p>
    <p class="center"><a href="mailto:team@ladypenh.com" class="bigred">team@ladypenh.com</a></p>
    <p>And of course, <a href="mailto:events@ladypenh.com">send us your events</a>!</p>

      <span class="bul">&sup;</span> Here are the <em>events 
        of the week</em> in a 
      <a target="_blank" href="/print.html">printable page</a>. 
      Every event we are aware of is listed,
      but some events might be added at the last minute, 
      so you should visit us often anyway ;-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bul">&sup;</span> Here is
      a <a target="_blank" href="/feed/atom">live RSS/Atom feed</a> featuring
      the <em>Phnom Penh Events of the day</em>. You can use it
      from your desktop or web feed reader. 
      If you count yourself among the ever-growing number of people who are in 
      charge of an interesting resource
      about Cambodia, you may consider publishing our feed. Get in touch with us
      if you need help/advice!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bul">&sup;</span> You can also get the Phnom Penh 
      Events of the Day in your mailbox every morning (subscribe 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=LadyPenhEventsOfTheDay&amp;loc=en_US">here</a>), or follow us on

      Lady Penh has made its way into the most visited websites in 
      Cambodia - you can check our statistics as published by 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ladypenh.com">Alexa</a>, and even compare our traffic with other websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to achieve a sustainable model for Lady Penh by 
      developing front-page advertising: we have four spaces 
      available (at the bottom) on a weekly or monthly basis. 
      Four spaces - this is no mass 
      advertising, what is published there is guaranteed to be seen 
      by all of our visitors without bothering them. If your business 
      or initiative targets 
      a Phnom Penh audience, this makes sense: <em>we help you to 
        communicate with this audience, and you help us to 
        promote events in Phnom Penh.</em> Deal.             
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need something more distinctive, you may want to sponsor
      us on a monthly basis. Think: 
      <em>Lady Penh is brought to you by...</em> The whole top banner is yours!
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least: top-notch templating at your colors for the 
      whole website, exclusive from any other advertisement. To be 
      considered for launching campaigns!
