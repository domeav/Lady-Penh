This project began as an experimentation with Google App Engine, but
it became a quite successful little website (http://ladypenh.com).

Designed to scratch my own itch, so the code base could be vastly
improved to be useful to anyone wanting to build a similar website.

It's based on the now-defunct app-engine-patch, and should be
rewritten one of these days.
